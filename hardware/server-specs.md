***Storage Notes:***
- Consider upgradeing to SSD--NVMe preferred, SATA III at least--to improve VM performance
- Current setup should be suitable for my first few planned projects.
- Backup Strategy: Create and export backups to main PC's high capacity reserve drive (2TB 7200RPM Seagate Barracuda Compute HDD, mostly unused currently besides some game saves from games I havent played in a while). Should prove sufficient while I learn more about data redundancy and automation of these tasks. See [backup-strategies.md](proxmox/backup-strategies.md) for more info.

## Additional Information - Known Limitations and Considerations

### Current Constraints:

1. **Storage Issues**
    - **Speed:** 5400 RPM HDD limits VM performance, boot times, app loading, etc
       - **Mitigation:** Planned SSD upgrade once budget improves
    - **Health:** Used disk from old business laptop, unknown amount of power-on-hours
       - **Mitigation:** Backup strategy and regular SMART testing to ensure drive health is properly monitored

2. **RAM Capacity:** 16GB limits the number of concurrent VMs
    - **Impact:** Lighter VMs required, may need lighter Linux distros to save on resources
    - **Mitigation:** Use lighter distros, monitor resource usage, allocate smartly

4. **Single NIC:** No network redundancy
    - **Impact:** Single point of failure for network connectivity
    - **Mitigation:** Acceptable risk for homelab usecase -> failure is unlikely, and the majority of planned services are non-vital and therefore potential downtime is more acceptable if replacement NIC has to be purchased.

5. **Non ECC RAM:** No error correction for system memory
    - **Impact:** Increased (though still minimal) risk of memory errors
    - **Mitigation:** Regular backups of VMs saved to multiple locations (server drive, personal drive, potentially cloud sync), acceptable risk for homelab usecase with those precautions.
  
### Future Upgrade Paths:

1. Boot SSD *(Highest Priority)*
    - NVMe or SATA SSD for VM performance gains
    - Ideally 250-500GB
    - Move current drive to store backups only
        - less critical task
        - local backup storage only for redundancy
    - Budget Estimate: ~$50-$100

2. RAM Expansion *(Medium Priority)*
    - 16GB -> 32GB+
    - Potentially faster, likely around 3600MHz max for stability purposes
    - Will allow for VMs with more intensive workloads
    - Budget Estimate: $120-$180

3. Longer-term Considerations *(Low Priority)*
    - Dedicated Mass Storage (High-Capacity HDD for monitoring software logs, full system backups, etc.)
    - Case/Ventilation upgrade -> more fans and/or a more open case for better airflow
    - Aftermarket CPU cooler for lower thermals -> higher clock speeds for vCPUs
    - UPS for protection against power interruptions
